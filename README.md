# 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

Q: What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

A: The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was to develop a advising assistance software for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The software was aimed at helping academic advisors in their interactions with students by providing them with course information and prerequisites.

Q: How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

A: To approach the problem, I first analyzed the requirements and designed a solution. I recommended the use of a suitable data structure to store and manage the course information efficiently. In this case, I chose a data structure that could hold course objects, which would allow easy retrieval and manipulation of course data. Understanding data structures is important because they provide a way to organize and store data in a program. By choosing an appropriate data structure, we can optimize the efficiency of our program's operations, such as searching, sorting, and retrieval. 

Q: How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

A: While working on the activities or project, I encountered roadblocks such as understanding how to read data from a file, implementing sorting algorithms, and designing an effective menu system. To overcome these roadblocks, I used various resources such as documentation, online tutorials, and examples to learn and understand the necessary concepts and techniques. I also utilized the knowledge gained from previous coursework. Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks and tackling them one by one helped me overcome these roadblocks effectively.

Q: How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

A: This project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by emphasizing the importance of planning and considering various aspects of a problem before jumping into coding. It highlighted the significance of understanding the requirements, designing an appropriate solution, and selecting suitable data structures to efficiently manage and manipulate data.

Q: How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through this project, I have learned the importance of adhering to industry-standard best practices to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.  I have utilized in-line comments and followed appropriate naming conventions to enhance the code's readability and maintainability.
